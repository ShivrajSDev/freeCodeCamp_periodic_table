# freeCodeCamp - Periodic Table Database Project

This is one of the projects that requires implementation as part of [freeCodeCamp's Relational Database Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/).

As part of the [project's requirements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/build-a-periodic-table-database-project/build-a-periodic-table-database), this repository includes the following files:

- A periodic_table.sql file that creates a PostgreSQL database with the data needed for passing the test.
- A element.sh bash file that searches for an element within the database based on a given argument and displays its info if found.
